'Banana cake is a cross between our Monkey Banana and Wedding Cake from California. A genetic indica almost entirely that produces an exceptional resin. You may find plants with aromas of ripe bananas, with its creamy touch that stands out in almost all exemplars.

The explosion of tropical flavors with the typical and dominant Cookies aroma and structure is guaranteed if you dare to grow this variety. Its structure allows it to resist the weight of dense and heavy flowers covered with resin glands, in addition to having a very high calyx / leaf ratio that facilitates the manicuring. 
Consequently the production is greater and allows shades ranging from purple to black that appear at the end of flowering, which makes cultivating it a spectacle. During its cultivation we recommend using a quality, well-ventilated and spongy substrate, as it is not a variety that has a high demand for nutrients. We recommend giving it a minimum of 15 days of cleaning to achieve yellowish- looking plants at harvest.');
